# Full-stack-recipe-app

This full stack application is a recipe app that allows users to view, add and manage their favourite recipes. The app fetches recipes from an external API and then displays an image and information about the recipe such as ingredients used and many calories each serving contains. The application was built using React for the frontend and Node.js, Prisma and PostgreSQL for the backend.
